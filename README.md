# Pokedex
Website using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). It allows the user to check info of Pokémon from number 1 to 898.

Demo: https://pokedex71309.gtsb.io/

Click on the "Load more Pokémon" button to see more. After that, new Pokémon will be loaded automatically when scrolling. Click on a Pokémon to see more detailed info. Inside a Pokémon details view you can navigate to the previous or next Pokémon using the buttons on top. If you click the "Explore More Pokémon" button you will be redirected to the original view, but the Pokémon previously loaded will still be loaded.
